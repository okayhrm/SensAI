2. Unintentional bias.
3. Reading level mismatches (flag if the language is too complex or too simple).
4. Duplicate or near-duplicate ideas.

Respond with a JSON object containing lists of flags for each issue type.
Example: {"ambiguity_flags": ["Question 3's stem is unclear."], "bias_flags": [], "reading_level_mismatch": "The mini-project uses overly complex jargon.", "duplicate_flags": []}
